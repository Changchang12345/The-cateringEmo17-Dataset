Great for the chicken under the brick twice!	6	eeb44vn
They take credit/debit cards.	1	ee9k3mb
They are all light somewhat boring choices.	2	eehnpae

Now we went to the Hop Works Bike Bar on day 2 and the regular Hop Works on day 3 so I'm mixing the reviews together.	1	eeqtfyj
Had a great time, all they require is that you buy 2 bottles of water and smoke all you want.	4	ed4cyt9
Having more side dishes would be a sweet deal as opposed to paying $12 for just rice and the main entree.	0	eearpfv
Moist, not too sweet bread filled with banana and walnuts served at room temp as a tasty afternoon treat that definitely hits the spot.	0	eez2zeq
The afternoon tea platter for two was very tasty, and very filling.	0	edd7xzx
The service was decent but the food left a lot to be desired.	5,10	edtamzl
